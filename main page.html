    As another year unfolds, the cosmos continues to beckon with its endless mysteries and captivating beauty. 
    2024 promises to be a year brimming with exciting developments in space exploration, 
    from venturing deeper into our own solar system to searching for signs of life beyond Earth.

  <h1>Moon Missions Take Center Stage</h1>
  <p>
    2024 marks a crucial year for lunar exploration, 
    with several significant missions scheduled. NASA's Artemis 2 mission, currently slated for November, 
    will send a crew of four astronauts on a lunar flyby mission, paving the way for Artemis 3 in 2025, 
    aiming for the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in 1972. Additionally, the VIPER rover will be deployed 
    later this year, searching for water ice deposits in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon. 
    This information will be critical for establishing a sustainable human presence on the lunar surface.
  </p>
  <br><br>          

  <h1>Seeking Answers Beyond Earth</h1>
  <p>
    Beyond the Moon, several exciting missions are set to broaden our understanding 
    of the solar system and beyond. The Europa Clipper mission, launching in October, will embark on a multi-year 
    journey to study Jupiter's moon, Europa, investigating the potential for a subsurface ocean and its suitability for
     life. Additionally, the JAXA Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission, targeted for launch in September, 
    aims to return samples from Mars' moon Phobos, providing insights into the moon's origins and potential 
    links to Mars itself.
  </p>

  <h1><i>Spaceflight Reaches New Heights</i></h1>
  <p>
    The year will also witness progress in commercial spaceflight. 
    SpaceX aims to conduct the first orbital test flight of its Starship vehicle, a massive reusable spacecraft 
    envisioned for deep space missions, including potential future trips to Mars. Additionally, companies like Axiom 
    Space will continue facilitating private astronaut missions to the International Space Station (ISS), marking a 
    growing trend in commercialization of space travel.
